Traffic Accident Analysis – Prodigy InfoTech Task 05
# 🚗 US Accidents Analysis 

This project explores patterns in U.S. traffic accidents using a large dataset of over 7 million records. The goal is to identify how **time of day**, **weather**, and **road conditions** affect accident frequency and severity.

## 📁 Dataset Used

- 📌 **Source:** [US Accidents (Sobhan Moosavi) – Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents)
- 🔸 Over 7.8 million accident records
- 🔸 Covers 49 U.S. states (2016–2023)
- 🔸 Includes date/time, location, weather, and road features

## 📊 Key Analyses

### 1. 🕒 Accidents by Hour
- Most accidents happen during **rush hours** (7–9 AM and 4–6 PM).

### 2. 📆 Accidents by Day of Week
- **Fridays** and **weekdays** see the highest volume.

### 3. 🌧️ Weather Conditions
- Clear weather is most common, but **Rain**, **Fog**, and **Snow** increase accident likelihood.

### 4. 🚦 Road Features
- High accident rates near **Junctions**, **Traffic Signals**, and **Crossings**.

### 5. 🌍 Hotspot Map (Folium)
- A heatmap of 1,000 accident locations visualizes **U.S. accident density** by location.
